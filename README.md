analyzing bike share system of 3 major US cities in python

## Introduction
This project analyzes the bike sharing system in the cities of Chicago, NYC and Washington. The program is written in python (my first python project and first Github projecct too) and allows user interaction to filter the data according to the user. It displays descriptive stats of the data and visuals supporting these stats.

## Input 
The input data is a combination of 3 different files in .csv format. These files pertain to data about the 3 different cities as mentioned below with the file names:  
	- Chicago (chicago.csv)  
	- New York City (new_york_city.csv)  
	- Washington (washington.csv)  
 
## Function
The program asks the user to select a city and allows user to filter data based on month(January to June), day of the week and hour of the day so descriptive statistics can be calculated accordingly. 

## Result
Once filtered the user can view descriptive statistics like:  
	Time stats: Most common month, day, hour  
	Station Stats: Most common start station, end station and most common trip  
	Trip duration stats: Average and total trip duration  
	User Stats: User type (like subscriber/customer/dependant), gender, birth year  

Some of these stats have corresponding visuals tht allow for a better understanding. 

The user is also given the option to look at the raw data or select few rows to view from the raw data.
